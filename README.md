1. Format the code -- always!
2. Give the first form a better filename (index.html or index.php).  Does it matter?
3. Make sure that, as an end-user, you can navigate from start to finish.
4. Process the form data so that all of the input is displayed on the final page.
5. Feel free to rename other files as well.
6. Do whatever you can to make your web app easy to use (i.e., grade).  Thanks!
